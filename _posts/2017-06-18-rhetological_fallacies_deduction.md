Deduction is a process of reasoning in which a conclusion follows necessarily from the premises presented, so that the conclusion cannot be false if the premises are true.

Rhetological fallacies, on the other hand, are errors and forms of manipulations of rhetoric and logical thinking.

## **Anectodal Evidence** ##

Discounting evidence arrived at by systematic search or testing in favor of a few firsthand stories.

Assuming that characteristics or beliefs of some or all of a group applies to the entire group.

## **Division** ##

Assuming that characteristics or beliefs of a group automatically apply to any individual member.

Assuming the history of outcomes will affect future outcomes.

## **Hasty Generalization** ##

Drawing a general conclusion from a tiny sample.

## **Jumping to Conclusions** ##

Drawing a quick conclusion without fairly considering relevant (and easily available) evidence.

## **Middle Ground** ##

## **Perfectionist Fallacy** ##

Assuming that the only option on the table is perfect success, then rejecting anything that will not work perfectly.

## **Relativist Fallacy** ##
![image-left](http://i.imgur.com/DuEpy3q.png){: .align-left}
Rejecting a claim because of a believe that truth is relative to a person or a group.

## **Spotlight** ##

Assuming an observation from a small sample size applies to an entire group.

## **Sweeping Generalization** ##

Assuming because two things share a commkon property, that makes them the same thing.

*“A theory can mean an unproven idea. Scientists use the term evolutionary theory. Therefore evolution is an unproven idea."*
